    <h2>How To Make Chicken Enchiladas Rojas</h2>
    <h3>FOR THE ENCHILADA SUACE</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Toast the Peppers.</strong> First, heat a large pan to medium heat and dry toast the dried chili peppers a few minutes per side, until the skins begin to puff up a bit. This is an important step, as it helps to release the oils in the skins, which is HUGE for flavor.</li>
            <img src="../img/enchiladas_rojas_sauce_img_two.jpg" alt="Chiles heating in pan" height="210" width="410">
            <li><strong>Soak the Peppers.</strong> Set the peppers into a large bowl and pour hot water over them, just enough to cover them. Let them soak for 20 minutes, or until they become very soft.</li>
            <img src="../img/enchiladas_rojas_sauce_img_three.jpg" alt="Wet chiles being put into a food processor" height="210" width="410">
            <li><strong>Food Processor.</strong> Remove the softened peppers and set them into a food processor or blender.</li> 
            <li><strong>Next</strong>, pour in some of the soaking liquid. You'll notice that it has become quite dark from the peppers. This water has plenty of nutrients leached from the peppers, so I like to use it. You can also use clean water if you'd like. Add about 1 cup to start.</li>

            <li><strong>Onion and Garlic.</strong> Next, cook down some onion and garlic in a pan with oil, then add them to the food processor along with the rehydrated peppers. Add sea salt to your preference.</li>
            <li><strong>Process Until Smooth.</strong> Process the mixture until the sauce becomes very smooth. It will be very thick at this point. Add in more water, a half cup at a time, until you achieve your desired consistency.</li>

    <h3>FOR THE CHICKEN ENCHILADAS</h3>
    <img src="../img/enchiladas_rojas_set-up_img_one.jpg" alt="The steps to setting up an enchilada" height="580" width="580">
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Chicken.</strong> Get your shredded cooked chicken ready. I like to mix it with some of the finished red enchilada sauce for additional flavor. YUM!</li>
            <li><strong>The Sauce.</strong> Strain the sauce into a pan with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Heat until it just starts to boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.</li>
            <li><strong>The Tortillas.</strong> Next, heat a separate pan to medium heat and add a bit of the remaining olive oil. Cook the tortillas a few seconds in the oil until they become pliable. You may need to keep adding a bit more oil as you go along.</li>
            <li><stong>Dip the Tortillas and Assemble the Chicken Enchiladas.</stong> Dip each tortilla into the warmed enchilada sauce, then set it onto a work surface. Fill each with seasoned shredded chicken mixture and shredded cheese. Roll the tortillas up and serve them onto plates. Top them with remaining sauce, if desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish and Serve.</strong> Garnish with crumbly cheese, fresh herbs and spicy red chili flakes.</li>
            <p><strong>BOOM! Done!</strong> Chow down, my friends! It doesn't get any better than this.</p>
