    <h2>What’s in this Birria Tacos Recipe?</h2>
        <p>Cheesy, juicy, crispy, and loaded with flavor, these birria tacos are a must-try. Slow-cooked beef birria, encased in a crispy taco, with a divine dip – you will love them!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chiles:</strong> Stemmed and seeded dried Guajillo chiles and dried Ancho chiles give birria its characteristic deep red color and rich, complex flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Beef:</strong> I like the combination of chuck roast and bone-in short ribs, but you could use just one or the other. If you have it available, you can also use oxtail in place of the short ribs.</li>
                <li><strong>Salt + Pepper:</strong> Season the beef thoroughly to bring out the flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetable Oil:</strong> Helps the beef to cook without burning.</li>
                <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> Help form the base of the braising liquid and add acidity and rich tomato flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Onion + Garlic:</strong> Add earthy flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Beef Broth:</strong> Forms the base of the braising liquid.</li>
                <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Coriander, cumin, oregano, chili powder, and cinnamon are classic Mexican seasonings.</li>
                <li><strong>Orange Juice:</strong> Adds acidity and citrus flavor to the braising liquid.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar:</strong> Adds acidity to the braising liquid.</li>
                <li><strong>Tortillas:</strong> I like corn tortillas for birria, but flour or cassava flour tortillas also work.</li>
                <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> I’m a big fan of Monterey jack, but you can substitute your favorite cheese here.</li>
                <li><strong>Cilantro:</strong> Adds a pop of freshness.</li>
            </ul>
