    <p>This easy <strong>shrimp ceviche recipe</strong> only requires a handful of ingredients and tastes so good! It’s a light and refreshing meal that’s perfect for summer or can easily be served as an appetizer!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients for Shrimp Ceviche</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Raw Shrimp:</strong> We use <strong>medium to large shrimp</strong> for our ceviche. (21-25 count) I wouldn’t suggest using smaller shrimp <em><strong>(like bay shrimp)</strong></em> as they can have a very different taste and texture to them.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> We always use <strong>cherry</strong> or <strong>grape tomatoes</strong> for our ceviche.</li>
            <li><strong>Persian cucumber:</strong> They're <strong>smaller in size</strong> and have a <strong>thinner skin</strong> than regular cucumbers. <em>(Plus <strong>less seeds</strong> too!)</em> English cucumbers would also work for this recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion: Red Onions</strong> work the best for this recipe!</li>
            <li><strong>Cilantro:</strong> Use the <strong>leaves and stems</strong> for maximum flavor!</li>
            <li><strong>Jalepeno:</strong> Always <strong>deseed your jalepeno</strong>! <em>(We want flavor - not the heat.)</em></li>
            <li><strong>Limes:</strong> An essential ingredient for every ceviche recipe!  It's hard to tell exactly how many limes you'll need (some are juicier than others), but we'll usually use about <strong>8-12 Limes</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Avocado:</strong> Optional but <strong>definitely recommended</strong>! You can dice it and mix it into your ceviche or mash it and spread it over tostadas.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How To Make Shrimp Ceviche</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare your shrimp.</strong> Rinse your shrimp and remove the tail shells. Then cut each shrimp into bite sized pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Marinate.</strong> Add your chopped shrimp in a large baking dish and pour your lime juice over the top. <em><strong>(You'll need enough lime juice to completely submerge your shrimp.)</strong></em> Then cover the dish with plastic wrap and leave it out at room temperature for 1 hour. Once the hour is up, transfer your dish to the refrigerator to continue cooking for 1-2 more hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Add your chopped veggies.</strong> While the shrimp is marinating, cut the rest of your ingredients and add them to the dish 15-30 minutes before you're ready to serve.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve!</strong> Serve your ceviche with tortilla chips, tostada shells, mashed avocado or guacamole if desired.</li>
        </ol>
